####An artistic representation of online news articles as living organisms.

Waffle portrays articles on the new york times as living organisms. When articles are published, they are born with metadata that makes up their phenotype. Over time, as readers interact with the article, it grows and evolves into an animal with complicated traits and patterns. Waffle is a visualization of how an article is born, grows, and eventually dies.
